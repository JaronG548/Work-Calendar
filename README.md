# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The purpose of this project was to use the given starter code and fix the HTML and add JavaScript using jQuery and Dayjs to create a functional Work Day scheduler that shows the current date and will adapt based on the time of day in your schedule by showing different colors for the time blocks. It was difficult to use jQuery since I didn't fully understand it but I went through multple sources on how the code works and how to call on jQuery in my JavaScript. I now understand that jQuery and Dayjs make writing scripts a lot eaiser than just using basic JavaScript and adding a lot of functionality.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When you view the deployed code at https://jarong548.github.io/Work-Calendar/  you can see  the very top as the title as well as the current date. Below it you can see the actual 9-5 schedule that you can manipulate by adding text in the text area and clicking the save button which will log it in local storage. You will also be able to see the time blocks have colors which are gray, red, or green. Gray means it is in the past, red means it is in the present, and green means the future. The colors will change based on the current time which is checked in the JavaScript because of Dayjs.

## Credits

Learned about "$" in JavaScript and jQuery and how it is used to call upon jQuery. I also learned a little about jQuery elements: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-does-the-dollar-sign-mean-in-javascript/

I learned more about jQuery elements/attributes such as ".removeClass" as well as jQuery in general : https://api.jquery.com/removeClass/

I used these 3 sources to learn about parseInt() since I had trouble with the code: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parseint.asp
